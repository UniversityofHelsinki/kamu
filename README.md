# Kamu
Kamu is the external user database for the University of Helsinki, built on top
of Django and Bootstrap.

It’s used to store and manage information about external users and their
relationship to the university.

Kamu is built for the needs of the University of Helsinki, but it’s designed to
be adaptable to other similar use cases i.e. user information and role
management.

Check out the [documentation](https://kamu.pages.helsinki.fi/kamu/) for more 
information about Kamu, features etc.
